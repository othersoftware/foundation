# Features

We have extended Laravel's Router with our custom implementation, which allows
us to provide nested routes that are available in official Vue Router package
that are extremely useful in single page applications, this allows us to create
all sort of modals, drawers, tabs, etc. as nested routes.

There is also easy to use, Symfony like, route translations mechanism with
PHP attributes, with ready to use middleware, which sets proper app locale
based on request URL.

We have also some nice features for forms, toasts and smaller utilities which
makes it easy to control your frontend from the backend.
